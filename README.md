# DeadBeef-Engine
C++ DirectX 10 3D Engine I wrote before starting University in 2011.

Features:
1. State-based scene management
2. 3D rendering with normal mapping and specular materials
3. 2D objects and GUI
4. Spotlight shadow and lighting
5. Preset camera modes: orbit, ghost, FPS
6. Some LUA bindings
7. Dodgy C++ code

Example scenes:
